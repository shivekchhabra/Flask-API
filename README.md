This repository contains a code to:
	1- Make an ML model on a currency dataset from Kaggle

	3- Using ML model with a simple Flask service.
	4- Using flasgger to use the Flask API and produce a good UI for the user.


## How to use this repository?
After installing the requirements, simply prepare your own model from "random_ml.py"
or you may simply try running flask_simple.py / flask_webapp.py with the existing model.

PS- I am pushing in model and test files so you can see the results easily.
