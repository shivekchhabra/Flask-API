## What does this repository contain?
This repository contains a code to:
	1- Make an ML model on a currency dataset from Kaggle
	2- Saving the ML model as pickle.
	3- Using ML model with a simple Flask service.
	4- Using flasgger to use the Flask API and produce a good UI for the user.


## How to use this repository?
After installing the requirements, simply prepare your own model from "random_ml.py"
or you may simply try running flask_simple.py / flask_webapp.py with the existing model.

PS- I am pushing in model and test files so you can see the results easily.

Please check Output images for more clarity.
